<tr>
    <th>Advantages</th>
    <th>Disadvantages</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&#9788; Customer satisfaction by rapid, continuous delivery of useful software.</td>
    <td>&#9730; The project can easily get taken off track if the customer representative is not clear what final outcome that they want.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&#9788; People and interactions are emphasized rather than process and tools. Customers, developers and testers constantly interact with each other.</td>
    <td>&#9730; Only senior programmers are capable of taking the kind of decisions required during the development process. Hence it has no place for newbie programmers, unless combined with experienced resources.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>&#9788; Even late changes in requirements are welcomed.</td>
    <td>&#9730; In case of some software deliverables, especially the large ones, it is difficult to assess the effort required at the beginning of the software development life cycle.</td>
